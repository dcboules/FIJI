# FIJI

FIJI is our Senior Design Project with a specialization in embedded systems. 

The purpose of FIJI is to be a remote lock manager for organizations. An administrator can make an account and establish an organization name in the app's database, and receive an organization code. This admin can then provide the code to the staff and they can make an account as a staff, entering the code. The admin can access all locks, and allow staff to access control over specific locks.


## frontend
